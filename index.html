				</p>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Why do I need the SignalGuru?</strong>
				<p>Most Retail Investors have struggled with the timing of their BUY and SELL decisions. The investors are emotionally involved with the fund or stock they trade. SignalGuru is a mechanical system that provides BUY, HOLD and SELL informational alerts to aid in the decision process.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li><strong>How good are the signals from the SignalGuru?</strong>
				<p>Many signals are accurate over 70% of the time and have been highly profitable in trending markets. However, these results are measured over months and years and are not well suited for short term (for e.g.flash crash). Sometimes the market signals get whipsawed between "BUY" to "SELL".
				</p>
			</li>
			<li><strong>What are the performace results from the SignalGuru?</strong>
				<p>SignalGuru system has handily beaten most BUY and HOLD or strategic allocation models. Some of the excellent results are shared on the main screen of the website. These excellent results are based on both LIVE results since 2003 and some back tested results. There is absolutely no guarantee that past performance is indicative of future results.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Are you a broker or an investment advisor?</strong>
				<p>Absolutely NOT - The publisher is not a broker, or a financial advisor or RIA. The SignalGuru provides informational alerts only and is not be construed in any other way. It is strictly for information purposes. All trading decisions including whether it is appropriate for your specific financial condition, is to be solely determined by the reader. Please see detailed Terms of Service, License, Disclaimer and Customer Agreement.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li><strong>How does an ETF differ from an index mutual fund?</strong>
				<p>An ETF (Exchange Traded Fund) is an investment product that represents a basket of securities such as the S&P 500 Index. Unlike mutual funds, which are priced once a day after the US market closes,  ETF prices change throughout the day because they're traded like shares.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li><strong>What are the advantages of ETFs versus mutual funds?</strong>
				<p>ETFs typically charge 75% lower fees than actively managed mutual funds and offer investors a wide range of sectors, geographies and strategies.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Who is the owner of the the SignalGuru?</strong>
				<p>The publishing team has decades of experience developing various Global Wealth Management technical systems for companies such as Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Citigroup, Smith Barney, Microsoft.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li><strong> I already have a Financial Advisor. Why do I need another source of information from TheSignalGuru?</strong>
				<p>The SignalGuru provides additional technical information for discussions with your financial advisor or whoever you make decisions with.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li><strong>The SignalGuru model always books all trades on the last trading day of the month? I don't like to perform all the trades on the same date?</strong>
				<p>The goal of the SignalGuru model is to identify tradeable trends that have cleared key technical hurdles. Some of these trends last months and years and some just for a few weeks. So you can break up your trades into 2 or 3 chunks and perform your trades appropriately. The model is based on simplicity and hence it trades on the last trading day of the month. Studies have shown no significant differences in terms of relative out performance one way or other over a long time horizon.
